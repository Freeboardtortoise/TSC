# Developing plugins

## making the plugin

you must place the plugin file in the TSC/plugins directory and write your code there
develop your plugin using the TSC.client and TSC.server base packages
save your file and add the name into the /TSC/plugins/plugins.txt file

## Applying to make it an oficial plugin

make an isue with the tag "new plugin" in the https://github.com/Freeboardtortoise/TSC-plugins.git with your file atached and a discription and documentation if needed must provide the sourse code or your plugin wil be disrregarded in order to keep this library free and open seorce so people can find the isues and fix them also so that I can review the plugin to make sure that it is not malwhare or potentialy harmfull.
